# Key Features


### Modular Architecture

PyNest follows the modular architecture of NestJS, which allows for easy separation of concerns and code organization. Each module contains a collection of related controllers, services, and providers.

### Dependency Injection

PyNest supports dependency injection, which makes it easy to manage dependencies and write testable code. You can easily inject services and providers into your controllers using decorators.
Decorators

PyNest makes extensive use of decorators to define routes, middleware, and other application components. This helps keep the code concise and easy to read.

### Type Annotations

Type Annotations

PyNest leverages Python's type annotations to provide better tooling and help prevent errors. You can annotate your controllers, services, and providers with types to make your code more robust.
Code Generation

### Code Generation

PyNest includes a code generation tool that can create boilerplate code for modules, controllers, and other components. This saves you time and helps you focus on writing the code that matters.
